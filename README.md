Sweet and Savory Restaurant
Description
The goal of this project was to test my design and coding skills by creating an app for a restaurant.

I first started by creating a brand for the restaurant in Figma. I wanted to replicate the experience of producing an app for a customer. So, I designed a style guide using specific colors and fonts, as well as creating a custom logo.

The number of images for a restaurant app are usually high to advertise the menu, so I opted to build the project using Vite and ReactJS. This method would ensure that the images would load quickly, as opposed to using create-react-app.

The decision to use React was an easy one; React is a popular library, but I also really enjoy using React. I love component-based programming for its utility, particularly with navigation bars, footers, and forms. Using React also gave me a chance to practice hooks. Some hooks have been challenging to implement, but I will solidify those skills with more projects.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
